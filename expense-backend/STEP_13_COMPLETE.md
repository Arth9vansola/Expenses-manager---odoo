## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### **Intelligent Approval Strategies:**

#### **Sequential Approval**
```json
{
  "strategy": "sequential", 
  "approvers": [{"role": "manager"}, {"role": "admin"}]
}
```
**Logic:** Each approver must approve in order

#### **Percentage Approval**  
```json
{
  "strategy": "percentage",
  "percentage_required": 60,
  "eligible_approvers": [{"role": "manager"}, {"role": "admin"}]
}
```
**Logic:** 60% of eligible approvers must approve

#### **Special Approver**
```json
{
  "strategy": "special_approver", 
  "special_approvers": [{"role": "admin", "auto_approve": true}]
}
```
**Logic:** Admin can bypass normal workflow

#### **Any Manager / All Managers**
- **Any Manager:** First manager approval completes
- **All Managers:** Every manager must approve

## 📊 Sample Approval Rules Created

| Rule Name | Amount Range | Strategy | Categories | Logic |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Low Value** | $0.01 - $99.99 | Any Manager | Meals, Office, Transport | Any manager approves |
| **Medium Value** | $100 - $500 | Sequential | Meals, Office, Transport, Travel | Manager → Admin |
| **High Value** | $500 - $2000 | Percentage (60%) | Travel, Technology, Entertainment | 60% of managers/admins |
| **Very High Value** | $2000+ | Sequential (3 levels) | Travel, Technology, Other | Manager → Manager → Admin |
| **Healthcare** | Any Amount | All Managers | Healthcare | Every manager must approve |

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

✅ **Self-approval Prevention** - Users cannot approve own expenses  
✅ **Company Isolation** - Rules and approvals scoped to company  
✅ **Role-based Access** - Manager/admin permission validation  
✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - Users cannot approve same expense twice  
✅ **Audit Trail** - Every approval decision recorded with metadata  

---

## 🧪 Testing Status

### **Test Coverage:**
✅ **Sequential Approval Workflow** - Multi-step approval chains  
✅ **Rejection Workflow** - Expense rejection and workflow termination  
✅ **High-Value Approval** - Percentage-based approval thresholds  
✅ **Permission Boundaries** - Unauthorized access prevention  
✅ **Approval History** - Complete audit trail validation  

### **Sample Test Scenarios:**
1. **Employee submits $350 expense** → Manager approves → Admin approves → **APPROVED**
2. **Employee submits $45 expense** → Any manager approves → **APPROVED** 
3. **Employee submits $1200 expense** → 60% of managers approve → **APPROVED**
4. **Manager rejects expense** → Workflow terminates → **REJECTED**
5. **Employee tries to approve own expense** → **FORBIDDEN**

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### **Medium-Value Expense ($350):**
1. **Employee** submits expense
2. **Manager** receives pending approval notification
3. **Manager** approves → Expense moves to Admin
4. **Admin** approves → **EXPENSE APPROVED** ✅
5. **Complete audit trail** preserved

### **High-Value Expense ($1200):**
1. **Employee** submits expense  
2. **Multiple managers** receive approval requests
3. **60% threshold** (e.g., 3 of 5 managers) approve
4. **Automatic completion** when threshold met → **APPROVED** ✅

### **Rejection Scenario:**
1. **Employee** submits expense
2. **Manager** reviews and finds issues
3. **Manager** rejects with comment → **EXPENSE REJECTED** ❌
4. **Workflow terminates** - no further approvals needed
